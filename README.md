# Winery
Laravel project that syncs wines data from an RSS feed

The project has 2 pages:
- Dashboard, where the users can see, search and sort the wines
- Admin page, where an administrator can sync the wines data with an RSS feed - thus updating the database

If your app runs on localhost:8000:
- http://localhost:8000 to access the dashboard
- http://localhost:8000/admin to access the admin page

To run the app:
- Clone it
- Setup a server
- Setup a database
- Change the .env file with the database info
- Go to /admin and sync from the RSS feed
